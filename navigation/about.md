## About this game
This game helps beginners learn the setup process and gives them live checks on their progress and where they are during the experience. Since we learned this process recently, we noted down all the common problems we had and set up questions along with each one. This helps beginners know where they are, so they don't go ahead without knowing what they are doing, and also helps them fully understand what they are doing about each progress.


##  What we did

We decided to create mini quizzes that guide the viewer into setting up their device. We made three different sections, one for mac, one for windows, and one for kasm. Each section has ten or more questions. We believe this will help brand new users navigate their way through setting up their devices because it provides explanations to what they got wrong and guide them into getting the correct answer, and encourages them if they get the correct answer. 



##  Why we did these
We faced many problems  of set up ourselves. This progress is quite challenging and has a lot of content. We think set a quiz for set up is an awesome idea. It's quite relax to do a small quiz rather than read all steps of set up which is so boring. 
- A whole article can confuse the new people, quizzes have fewer words to read, and help people locate more easily.
- It also motivates people by giving correct and wrong answers. Quizzes require learners to actively recall information rather than passively read or listen, which helps deepen understanding and retention. 
- We believe this will help brand new users navigate their way through setting up their devices because it provides explanations to what they got wrong and guide them into getting the correct answer, and encourages them if they get the correct answer. (e.x. confetti and feedback)



##  Our future plans
Once quiz is complete, students will recieve their diagnostic
diagnostic is used to help push students to articles and videos that will help them in their weaker areas. Also more personalized quizzes used in order to double check the understanding of the content after providing articles and videos.
