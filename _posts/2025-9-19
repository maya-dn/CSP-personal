## üîë Key Lessons from the RPS Console Project

Working with Rock Paper Scissors inside the browser console taught us more than just how to play a game.  
It showed us **how developers think, debug, and organize code**. Here‚Äôs what we took away:

---

### 1. Comfort with Developer Tools
We learned how to **open and navigate** the browser‚Äôs developer tools ‚Äî especially the Console tab.  
Typing commands directly into the console helped us understand how JavaScript runs behind the scenes.

---

### 2. Functions and Parameters
The game required calling `playRPS("rock")`, `playRPS("paper")`, or `playRPS("scissors")`.  
This taught us how **functions** work and how different **arguments** change the outcome of a program.

---

### 3. Debugging and Live Coding
By experimenting in the console, we saw:
- How to test commands quickly  
- How error messages guide debugging  
- How live coding helps us learn faster than editing and refreshing files  

---

### 4. Introduction to OOP
We also explored **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
Each game button (Rock, Paper, Scissors) could be treated as an **object** with properties (size, color) and methods (animate, rotate).  
This showed us how OOP makes code **modular and reusable**.

---

### 5. Creativity with the Console
The project encouraged us to customize the game ‚Äî changing button colors, sizes, and styles directly in the console.  
This made coding feel **interactive and playful**, while still reinforcing real programming skills.

---

## üìù Reflection
Overall, this project taught us:
- How to navigate developer tools with confidence  
- How functions, parameters, and objects connect in JavaScript  
- That debugging is a normal, even fun, part of coding  
- That OOP gives structure and power to interactive programs  

The biggest takeaway: **the console is not just for errors ‚Äî it‚Äôs a learning playground** where we can test ideas, practice code, and see results instantly.
