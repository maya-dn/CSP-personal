## Week 1
- We started by creating a Github account and an OpenCodingSociety account 
- Then Accessed VSCode through the URL provided in class
"VSCode.dev"
- Then we worked on our About page using vscode.dev 
- Next, we focused on building our tools on VScode, by typing the following codes into your terminal, I use a Windows computer
Start by installing VSCode and Homebrew: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Then install WSL by using the code on a terminal: wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
Then, set up a username and Password when prompted, just type "exit" once done 
- Then, run these commands on your terminal, set up your Ubuntu developer tools for the first time
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager.exe"
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate_ubuntu.sh # prompts for your recently created WSL Ubuntu password
./scripts/activate.sh # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
./scripts/venv.sh
- Run these commands to verify your system setup and check installed tools.

python --version
pip --version
ruby -v
bundle -v
gem --version
git config --global --list

- Restarting a terminal
Open Terminal by right clicking on Terminal in Taskbar and selecting Ubuntu 24.04

Each time you open a new terminal session, run these commands to activate your environment and start working on the student project in VS Code.

cd opencs/student
source venv/bin/activate
code .
This will clone(copy) Open Coding Society's student REPO into your machine so you will have your own version of it to access for the course, in that terminal, you will then want to clone the "pages" repo with the same steps
NOW YOU ARE DONE WITH SETTING UP YOUR BASIC TOOLS!
